# Basketball Stats
## Project Overview
This Streamlit app allows users to explore NBA player statistics from the 1996â€“2022 seasons. The app focuses on making basketball data more accessible by transforming height and weight metrics into familiar units (inches and pounds), adding filters for teams and seasons, and enabling visual insights into scoring performance across age and time. It provides a simple, interactive way to understand player trends and compare stats across years and franchises.
