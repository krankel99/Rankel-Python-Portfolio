# Tidy Data Project
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to take a messy Olympic medal dataset and clean it using tidy data principles. As defined by Hadley Wickham, tidy data means each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observation is stored in its own table. This project demonstrates how reshaping, splitting, and cleaning data improves usability for analysis and visualization. Once tidied, the dataset is used to generate clear visualizations, including a bar plot of the top 10 medal-winning sports and a pie chart of medal distribution by gender. This process highlights how proper data structuring simplifies analysis and lets us focus on meaningful insights.

## Setup and Run Instructions
- Download the dataset https://github.com/krankel99/Rankel-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/TidyData-Project/olympics_08_medalists.csv and make sure it is in the same folder as `Tidy_data_project.ipynb`

## Dataset Description
This project analyzes medal counts from the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. The original dataset required cleaning: it was initially in a “wide” format, so I reshaped it into a “long” format following tidy data principles. I also split a column that contained multiple variables into two distinct columns, then removed the original mixed column and any rows with null values. These steps made the data analysis-ready and enabled the creation of clear, informative visualizations.
