# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to work with a dataset and "tidy" it up and then create visualizations with it. Tidy data principles, as talked about by Hadley Wickham, emphasize structuring data in a way that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. This standardization facilitates data manipulation, modeling, and visualization, allowing for more efficient analysis and minimizing the need for extensive data cleaning. By using a consistent data structure and tools, tidying makes complex datasets easier to handle, thereby enabling analysts to focus on domain-specific problems rather than data logistics.

# Instructions
The notebook has three libraries: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. In order to run the notebook, open it up in VS Code and follow the steps on the notebook and if confused read the comments for each code.

# Dataset Description
I looked at data for the medal counts for the 2008 Olympics which were held in Beijing. The data was a little messy when I first started, but I cleaned it up by changing the format so it was "long" and not "wide" and then split a column that contained two different values into two columns and then removed the original column as well as any null values.
