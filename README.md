# Projects
## Basketball Stats
Under basic-streamlit-app is a file called main.py which contains basketball stats for players from the 1996 season until the 2022 season.
## Olympic Medal Count for the 2008 Olympics
Under TidyData-Project is a filed called tidy_data_project which contains the count for olympic medals from the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. In this project, I worked with cleaning up data including dropping NaN values, melting data from "wide" into "long" format, and splitting columns. I show two visualizations, a barplot that shows the top 10 medal breakdown by sports and a pie chart that shows the breakdown of medals by gender. This how complemented my overall portfolio as it shows that I am able to transform data and clean it up so I can create visualizations with it which is extremely useful in the real world.
