# Projects
## [Basketball Stats](https://github.com/krankel99/Rankel-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
This Streamlit app presents NBA player statistics from 1996 to 2022. I cleaned the dataset by converting height and weight from metric to imperial units, enabling more intuitive analysis. The app includes interactive filters for team and season, and two dynamic visualizations: one for points per game by season and another showing average points by age. It demonstrates proficiency in data transformation, exploratory analysis, and dashboard development.

## [Olympic Medal Count for the 2008 Olympics](https://github.com/krankel99/Rankel-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
This project analyzes Olympic medal data using a tidy data approach. I cleaned the dataset by removing missing values, reshaping the data from wide to long format, and splitting multi-value columns. The visual output includes a barplot of the top 10 medal-winning sports and a pie chart showing gender distribution. This project highlights my ability to manipulate real-world data and extract insights using clean, organized datasets.

## [NER Custom Application](https://github.com/krankel99/Rankel-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)
This app allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition using spaCy. It combines statistical NER (`en_core_web_sm`) with a rule-based `EntityRuler`, letting users upload text and input custom patterns. Entities are visually displayed inline using `displaCy`, and custom rules persist across sessions with Streamlitâ€™s `session_state`. This project showcases advanced NLP workflow design and interactive UI development.

## [Portfolio Analyzer](https://github.com/krankel99/Rankel-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)
Portfolio Analyzer is a full-featured Streamlit application designed to help investors monitor and understand their equity portfolios. Users can upload or type in their portfolio (ticker, quantity, and purchase price), and the app calculates real-time valuations, profit/loss metrics, Sharpe ratio, beta (5-year monthly), and sector diversification. Visual outputs include price charts, pie charts by value and sector, and performance comparison with the S&P 500. The app also includes a Sentiment Analysis tool where users can analyze earnings call transcripts or financial news using a transformer-based model. This project integrates finance, NLP, and data visualization in a clean, interactive experience.
